# Gatsby + Netlify CMS Boilerplate

This repo contains an example blog that is built with [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/), and [Netlify CMS](netlifycms.org): https://gatsby-netlify-cms.netlify.com/.

It follows the [JAMstack architecture](https://jamstack.org) by using Git as a single source of truth, and [Netlify](netlify.com) for continuous deployment, and CDN distribution.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node (I recommend using v8.7.0 or higher)
- Yarn
- A fork of the repo on your local machine

### Run Locally
```
$ cd gatsby-netlify-cms-boilerplate
$ yarn
$ gatsby build
$ gatsby serve
```

## Accessing the CMS
Follow the [Netlify CMS Quick Start Guide](https://www.netlifycms.org/docs/quick-start/) to set up authentication, and content modeling.
