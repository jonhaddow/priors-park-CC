Compassion Cafe is a place where each visit has a life-changing impact. Here, every penny you spend goes directly towards fulfilling Franchoise's dream of having a homeâ€”a young girl in Rwanda. Franchoise receives support through Compassion UK. We invite you to visit Tammie and our cafe team, where our kitchen is designed to resemble the home we envision for Franchoise. Indulge in our delightful coffee and mouthwatering treats, knowing that you are contributing to building a brighter future for Franchoise.
