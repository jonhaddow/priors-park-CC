We meet on Sundays at 3.30 to worship our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ and to listen to God’s word.

If you have children, they can join in the Pirate Kids Church.

The church is accessible for people with disabilities, and there is a loop system.

O﻿n the 2nd Sunday of every month we share Communion together

On the 3rd Sunday of each month, we hold an interactive service for families, followed by a meal together.
