Here at Priors Park Community Church, we are meeting the Covid-19 pandemic head on. We have started to combat lockdown in various ways. We are aware that there are many vulnerable and isolating members of our community that need to be remembered and cared for during this unprecedented period.

We have opened a food hub that is working with the Tewkesbury Community Response, local council and various other local authorities. We have been delivering food parcels, doing shopping trips, picking up prescriptions, giving out Foodbank vouchers, supplying Christmas hampers and essentials and we have opened a socially distanced support caf√© in the chapel on a Friday morning.

It goes without saying we are inspired to do this by our Wonderful God who has put it on our hearts to help our community.

We have been holding services live at the chapel every Sunday Afternoon at 3:30pm for people who wish to worship in a safe environment and even though we have had to keep the numbers to a safe level we have had many requests to attend and will continue to worship our Loving Lord and Saviour as long as we are legally allowed.
