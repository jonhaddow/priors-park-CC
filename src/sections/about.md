_Priors Park Community Church, the heart of the community._

We are a church who loves to please God and attract others to Christ.
We are a community which accepts people as they are.

With the Holy Spirit to help us,

- We bow to the rule of the Lord Jesus Christ
- We accept his right over our lives
- We follow Jesus
- We obey Jesus
- We serve Jesus

Following the COVID-19 pandemic, we have adapted how church is run. If you would like to know more, or book a place to come please contact Nigel Haddow on 07970013426
