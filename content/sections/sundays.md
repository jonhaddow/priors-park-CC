We meet on Sundays at 3.30 to worship our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ and to listen to Godâ€™s word.

If you have children, they can join in the Pirate Kids Church.

The church is accessible for people with disabilities, and there is a loop system.

On the 3rd Sunday of each month, we do an interactive service for families, followed by a meal together.
