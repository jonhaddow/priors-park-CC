We set up @Thechapel in response to the Covid 19 pandemic. It is a hub that helps with food distribution, financial and general problems for those struggling through difficult times.

If you are struggling with money and food we can help you. Please get in touch on 07307079129.

Through the summer we are running a breakfast club between 8-10 Monday- Friday. Anyone welcome.
