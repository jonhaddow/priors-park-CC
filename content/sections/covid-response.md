We set up @Thechapel in response to the Covid 19 pandemic. IT is a hub that helps with food distribution and money problems for those struggling 

We have been holding services live at the chapel every Sunday Afternoon at 3:30pm, and also provide a zoom link for those who would prefer to stay away. 

We run a support cafe every Tuesday for those who have been struggling with feeling alone. During the lockdown, we helped with providing food parcels. This has now stopped, however if you are struggling with money and food we can help you. Please get in touch on 07307079129
