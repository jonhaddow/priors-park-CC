Before Covid 19, on 1st and 3rd Sundays we would hold an interactive service and a free meal. We have now started this again on the 3rd Sunday of the month and would love you to come along, at 3.30. 

As a church, we are looking to support the community so please let us know if you need anything or need extra support during this time.
