Before Covid 19, we would do 1st and 3rd Sundays an interactive service and a meal. We have now started this again on the 3rd Sunday of the month and would love for you to come along, starting at 3.30. 

The mens group is also relaunching on a Friday, 7.30 in Weatherspoons Tewkesbury, Beer and Banter. 

As a church, we are looking to support the community so please let us know if you need anything or need extra support during this time.

Sunday 5th- 3.30 Celebrate with Compassion and a message from Francoise.
