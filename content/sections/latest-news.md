Before Covid 19, on 1st and 3rd Sundays we would hold an interactive service and a free meal. We have now started this again on the 3rd Sunday of the month and would love you to come along, at 3.30. 

The mens group is also relaunching on a Friday, 7.30 in Weatherspoons Tewkesbury, Beer and Banter. 

As a church, we are looking to support the community so please let us know if you need anything or need extra support during this time.

Sunday 5th- 3.30 Celebrate with Compassion and a message from Francoise, the child we sponsor in Rwanda.
